# How to write a WebSocket publisher based on a framework/library

This guide shows how to write a Wagtail Live publisher based on a framework or library that supports the WebSocket protocol. Examples: [Starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette), [Websockets](https://github.com/aaugustin/websockets), [Tornado](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/).

Here are the steps we need to take:

1. Server-side logic: Inherit from [`BaseWebsocketPublisher`](https://wagtail.github.io/wagtail-live/reference/publishers/base_websocket_publisher/) and implement the `publish` method. 
    
    This method handles publishing updates to websocket clients.

2. Client-side logic: Display updates when we receive them.

## Server-side logic: implement `publish` method

The design proposed here is heavily inspired by [this awesome guide](https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/django.html) from the `websockets` library docs. Here is an extract explaining the idea:

> We need a event bus to enable communications between Django and websockets. Both sides connect permanently to the bus. Then Django writes events and websockets reads them. For the sake of simplicity, weâ€™ll rely on Redis Pub/Sub.

Wagtail Live provides a `RedisPubSubPublisher` if we want to use Redis Pub/Sub as an event bus:

```python
from wagtail_live.publishers.redis import RedisPubSubPublisher

class MyWebsocketPublisher(RedisPubSubPublisher):
    pass
```

You can also provide your event bus and implement the `publish` method accordingly.

---

**Note:** The following packages can help you set up an event bus:

- [kombu](https://github.com/celery/kombu) - Messaging library for Python.
- [broadcaster](https://github.com/encode/broadcaster) - Broadcast channels for async web apps (Still in alpha phase).

---

In this architecture, we need to perform additional work to handle WebSocket connections.

### Handle WebSocket connections

Let's create an `app.py` file inside the publisher module where we define the `app`.

At a lower level, the `app` is an async callable or an ASGI app that handles WebSocket connections in these steps:

1. Accept a WebSocket connection and add it to the event bus.
2. Send a message to a WebSocket connection when a live page update is available.
2. Wait for a WebSocket connection to be closed and remove it from the event bus.

If our publisher inherits from `RedisPubSubPublisher`, we need to perform these steps:

1. Define the `broadcast` coroutine and instantiate a `RedisBus`.
    
    The purpose of the `broadcast` coroutine is to send a message to a group of WebSocket connections:

    ```python
    import asyncio

    async def broadcast(message, recipients):
        """Broadcasts `message` to `recipients`."""

        await asyncio.wait([ws.send_method(message) for ws in recipients])
    ```

    In a real implementation, the `send_method` corresponds to the 'send' method of a WebSocket connection object in the library/framework used.

    For example, with websockets the `send_method` is `send` and with starlette it's `send_json`, `send_text` or `send_bytes`.

    With the `broadcast` method defined, we can now instantiate an event bus:

    ```python
    from wagtail_live.publishers.redis import RedisBus
    from wagtail_live.publishers.utils import get_redis_url

    bus = RedisBus(url=get_redis_url(), broadcast=broadcast)
    ```

2. Run the bus on startup.

    Finally, we'll need to 'run' the bus when the `app` starts running.

    It will depend on how the framework/library used handles running tasks on startup.

    For example, with `websockets` we can use the `serve` context manager and run the bus as long as the server is running:

    ```python
    import websockets

    async with websockets.serve(handler, host, port):
        await bus.run()  # Run the event bus forever
    ```

    > Starlette applications can register multiple event handlers for dealing with code that needs to run before the application starts up, or when the application is shutting down:

    ```python
    from starlette.applications import Starlette

    app = Starlette()

    @app.on_event("startup")
    def startup():
        # Run the event bus on startup
        asyncio.create_task(bus.run())
    ```

You can see [`StarlettePublisherApp`](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail-live/blob/main/src/wagtail_live/publishers/starlette/app.py), [`WebsocketsPublisherApp`](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail-live/blob/main/src/wagtail_live/publishers/websockets/app.py) and [`DjangoChannelsApp`](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail-live/blob/main/src/wagtail_live/publishers/django_channels/app.py) for complete implementations of the `app`.

### Setup Django before running the `app`

Since we're using Django in a [standalone script](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/settings/#calling-django-setup-is-required-for-standalone-django-usage), we need to call `django.setup()` before running the `app`:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import django
    django.setup()

    # Run the app here
```

## Client side logic

Let's add client side logic to display updates when we receive them from the server side.

### Add javascript

We need to open a WebSocket connection with the server-side for each client.

Wagtail Live provides a base `WebsocketPublisher` that takes a `baseURL` parameter.

It exposes the following interface:

- `initialize_websocket_connection`: Opens a WebSocket connection with the `baseURL` provided.
- `initialize_on_message_event`: Registers a callback on new message events.
- `initialize_on_error_event`: Registers a callback on disconnect/error events.
- `start` (Implemented): Registers WebSocket events callbacks after a WebSocket connection is opened.

Wagtail Live also provides a `GenericWebsocketPublisher` if we use the native `Websocket` library.

We can define our publisher like this if we use it:

```javascript
const baseURL = `${serverHost}:${serverPort}`;
const FrameworkOrLibraryPublisher = new GenericWebsocketPublisher(baseURL);
FrameworkOrLibraryPublisher.start(); 
```

### Add template

Finally, let's add the publisher template that will be included in the live page template.

This template links to the publisher's javascript code and defines the constants the latter uses.

```html
{% load static wagtail_live_tags %}

<script>
    const serverHost = "{% get_server_host %}";
    const serverPort = "{% get_server_port %}";
</script>

<script src="{% static 'wagtail_live/js/websocket/websocket.js' %}"></script>
<script src="{% static 'path/to/publisher.js' %}"></script> 
```

## Wrap up

We have a fully implemented WebSocket publisher.

To use it:

1. Add it in the live page model template.

    ```html
    {% include "wagtail_live/live_posts.html" %}
    {% include "path/to/publisher.html" %}
    ```

2. Specify `WAGTAIL_LIVE_PUBLISHER`.

    ```python
    WAGTAIL_LIVE_PUBLISHER = "path.to.my.websocket.publisher.MyWebsocketPublisher"
    ```

3. Specify additional settings

    We may need to specify `WAGTAIL_LIVE_SERVER_HOST` and `WAGTAIL_LIVE_SERVER_PORT`.
